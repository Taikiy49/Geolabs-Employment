export const ALCOHOL_DRUG_PROGRAM_TEXT = `Alcohol & Drug Testing Program

The Company has a vital interest in maintaining a safe, productive, and efficient working environment for its employees and the public.
Using or being under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs on the job may pose serious safety and health risks not only for the user, but also to co-workers and the public.

To meet this compelling interest, and because the Company is required to comply with the Department of Transportation's Illegal Drugs and Alcohol Testing Regulations (49 CFR Parts 40 and 382),
applicants who wish to be considered for employment must agree to submit to pre-employment alcohol and drug testing.

By completing and signing this Notice and the attached Application for Employment, the applicant understands and agrees to submit to alcohol and drug testing as provided for in the Company’s Alcohol and Drug Program.
In addition to pre-employment testing, the program also sets forth requirements for reasonable suspicion testing, post-accident testing, random testing, return-to-duty testing, and follow-up testing.
A copy of the program may be obtained from the HR Manager, who is also the Designated Employer Representative (DER).

I further acknowledge that though Hawai‘i may allow for medical marijuana use by prescription, federal law prohibits such use and Geolabs, Inc. follows federal law.
I understand that if my work results in my being covered by DOT regulations, a positive test result for marijuana will result in appropriate disciplinary action and neither Geolabs, Inc. nor its Medical Review Officer (MRO) will accept a medical marijuana prescription to overturn a positive test result for marijuana.
I understand that if I am not subject to DOT regulations and I produce a valid medical marijuana prescription, I may be required to work with my physician to transition to a medication that is legal under federal law and to comply with all other testing and reporting requirements in this policy.

ANY APPLICANT WHO IS UNWILLING TO AGREE TO THESE CONDITIONS SHOULD NOT APPLY FOR EMPLOYMENT WITH GEOLABS, INC.

export const EEO_NOTICE_TEXT = `EEO Voluntary Self-Identification Survey (Applicant Data)

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires certain employers to complete an EEO-1 report each year.
Covered employers must invite employees and applicants to self-identify gender and race for this report.

Completion of this form is voluntary and your decision to provide or withhold this information will not affect your opportunity for employment,
or the terms or conditions of your employment. This form will be used for EEO-1 reporting purposes only and will be kept separate from all other personnel records
and accessed only by Human Resources.

If you choose not to self-identify at this time, the federal government allows Geolabs, Inc. to determine this information by visual survey and/or other available information.

export const DISABILITY_NOTICE_TEXT = `Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability (Form CC-305)

WHY ARE YOU BEING ASKED TO COMPLETE THIS FORM?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities.
We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal.
To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it.
Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form,
visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.

export const VETERAN_NOTICE_TEXT = `Protected Veteran Self-Identification (VEVRAA)

Under the regulations implementing the affirmative action provisions of the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA) of 1972 issued by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP),
federal contractors are required to invite applicants and current employees to inform the contractor whether they are veterans belonging to one or more of the categories of veterans covered under VEVRAA
who wish to benefit under the contractor’s affirmative action program (AAP) for covered veterans.

In extending this invitation, we advise you that:
(a) workers and applicants are under no obligation to respond but may do so in the future if they choose;
(b) responses will remain confidential within the Human Resources department; and
(c) responses will be used only for the necessary information to include in our affirmative action plan.

Refusal to provide this information will have no bearing on your application and will not subject you to any adverse treatment.
